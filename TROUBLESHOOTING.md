You're getting a 404 error at `https://brandf.github.io/nana` because GitHub Pages isn't activated yet.

## ✅ **Solution Steps**

### **Step 1: Activate GitHub Pages**
1. Go to: `https://github.com/brandf/nana/settings/pages`
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Click **"Save"**

### **Step 2: Check GitHub Actions**

2. Look for "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. It should show as running or completed

### **Step 3: Wait for Deployment**
- GitHub Pages can take **2-10 minutes** to deploy
- Check the Actions tab for deployment status
- Look for green checkmarks indicating success

## 🔍 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: "No Actions found"**
**Solution:** The workflow might not have triggered yet
- Wait 2-3 minutes after pushing
- Check if the workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

### **Issue: "Workflow failed"**
**Solution:** Check the error logs
- Go to Actions tab → Click on failed workflow
- Look for error messages in the build logs
- Common issues: missing dependencies, build errors

### **Issue: "Pages not found" after successful build**
**Solution:** GitHub Pages source not set correctly
- Go to Settings → Pages
- Ensure source is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Not "Deploy from a branch"

### **Issue: "Site loads but looks broken"**
**Solution:** Check the generated files
- The workflow should create files in `exports/website/`
- Verify `index.html` exists and has content
- Check for CSS/JS loading issues

## 🚀 **Quick Test Commands**

```bash
# Check if workflow file exists
ls .github/workflows/deploy.yml

# Trigger a rebuild
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger rebuild"
git push origin master

# Check Actions status
# Visit: https://github.com/brandf/nana/actions
```

If the site still doesn't work after following these steps:

1. **Check GitHub Status**: `https://www.githubstatus.com/`
2. **Verify repository name**: Must be exactly `nana`
3. **Check branch**: Must be `master`
4. **Wait longer**: Sometimes takes up to 10 minutes
5. **Try incognito mode**: Clear browser cache
