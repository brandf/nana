## üßÆ Cost Calculations

### **Personnel Cost Formula**
```
Annual Salary √ó FTE √ó (1 + Benefits Rate) = Total Annual Cost
```

**Example:**
- Program Director: $60,000 √ó 1.0 FTE √ó 1.30 = $78,000
- Family Coordinator: $45,000 √ó 0.5 FTE √ó 1.30 = $29,250

### **Equipment Cost Formula**
```
Unit Cost √ó Quantity √ó (1 + Shipping/Installation) = Total Cost
```

**Example:**
- Computers: $1,500 √ó 5 √ó 1.05 = $7,875
- Software licenses: $500 √ó 20 √ó 1.00 = $10,000

### **Professional Development Cost Formula**
```
(Registration + Travel + Accommodation) √ó Number of People = Total Cost
```

**Example:**
- Conference: ($500 + $800 + $400) √ó 4 people = $6,800
