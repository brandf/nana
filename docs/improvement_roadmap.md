# Learning Disabilities Research Project - Improvement Roadmap

*Captured from comprehensive analysis of research_report.md and for_teachers.md*

## 10 Strategic Improvements Identified

### 1. **Add Age/Grade-Specific Considerations**
**Priority:** High | **Effort:** Medium
- **Early Elementary (K-2)**: Focus on foundational skills, early warning signs

### 2. **Create a "Red Flags vs. Typical Development" Section**
**Priority:** High | **Effort:** Medium

- **Implementation**: New section in research_report.md

### 3. **Add Co-occurring Conditions Section**
**Priority:** High | **Effort:** Medium
- ADHD + Dyslexia (very common)
- ASD + Language disorders
- Anxiety + Learning disabilities
- How to prioritize interventions when multiple conditions present
- **Implementation**: New section in research_report.md

### 4. **Include Family Communication Templates** ✅ COMPLETED
