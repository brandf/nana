# Learning Needs in School-Age Children: Presentations, Research-Based Classroom Supports, and Teacher Resources

Audience: General education and special education teachers; school leaders

This guide summarizes common learning disabilities and related conditions that present in classrooms, what teachers tend to observe, and research-based supports that can be implemented without a diagnosis. It also includes teacher-friendly resources grounded in rigorous evidence. It is not a diagnostic tool; use it to inform support and documentation that can help families pursue formal evaluation.

## How to use this guide
- Observe: Match classroom behaviors with the “How it presents” lists.
- Support: Try the “What helps (evidence-based)” supports first; note responses.
- Document: Keep brief notes under “What to document” to share with families and evaluators.
- Refer: When concerns persist, coordinate with your school team to initiate [MTSS/RTI](https:///iris.peabody.vanderbilt.edu/module/rti01/) supports and, if needed, a formal special education/504 referral.

## Dyslexia (reading, word-level; language-based)

- How it presents (in class)
  - Slow, effortful oral reading; skips or guesses words; avoids reading aloud
  - Trouble with letter–sound mappings, blending, spelling; weak nonsense word reading
  - Comprehension improves significantly when text is read aloud
- What helps (evidence-based)
  - Explicit, systematic phonics and phonemic awareness within a [Structured Literacy](https:///dyslexiaida.org/structured-literacy/) approach (daily, cumulative, multisensory)
  - Teach morphology (prefixes/suffixes), high-utility spelling patterns; repeated reading for fluency
  - Access supports: audiobooks/text-to-speech; reduced volume of decoding-heavy work when task focus is content
  - Assessment accommodations: extended time; read-aloud for directions and non-reading constructs
- What to document for families/evaluators
  - Frequency/examples of decoding errors, fluency rates, spelling patterns, response to explicit phonics practice
- Teacher resources (evidence-based, teacher-friendly)

  - Spelling errors despite studying; written output far below oral expression
  - Fatigue/behavioral avoidance during writing
- What helps (evidence-based)
  - Teach handwriting explicitly (letter formation, spacing) with brief, frequent practice; keyboarding instruction as an alternative route
  - Use graphic organizers; sentence frames; explicit sentence/paragraph construction (planning → drafting → revising cycles)
  - Access supports: speech-to-text; scribe; reduced copy demands; provide guided or teacher notes
  - Assessment accommodations: extended time; alternate response modes (oral/typed)
- What to document
  - Samples showing legibility, speed, spelling error types; response to handwriting and keyboarding instruction
- Teacher resources

## Executive summary (for leadership/quick read)
- Many learning needs present first as classroom performance issues (reading fluency/accuracy, written output, math problem solving, attention/executive skills, language comprehension). Early, explicit, and well-structured supports are the highest-yield actions.
- Strong evidence supports explicit, systematic instruction (reading, writing, math), combined with assistive technology and reasonable assessment accommodations.
- Behavior-classroom management and organizational supports improve access for attention/executive challenges.
- Visual schedules, modeling, and structured routines improve predictability and engagement for ASD and related profiles.
- Teachers should document observations, supports tried, and student responses to streamline referrals and evaluations.
