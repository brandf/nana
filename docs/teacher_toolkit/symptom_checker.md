## üö® Red Flags - When to Escalate Immediately

**Contact support team right away if you see:**
- Student is a danger to self or others
- Severe academic regression
- Family requests evaluation
- Multiple teachers have similar concerns
- Student is completely disengaged despite supports

## üìä Progress Tracking

**After trying strategies for 3-5 days, ask:**
- Is the student more engaged?
- Is work completion improving?
- Are behaviors more positive?
- Is the student making progress toward goals?

**If YES:** Continue current strategies, document success
**If NO:** Try different strategies or involve support team

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Choose your strategy** from the options above
2. **Try it consistently** for 3-5 days
3. **Document results** using [Observation Template](../notes/teacher_observation_template.md)
4. **Adjust as needed** based on student response
5. **Involve others** if concerns persist

## üìû When to Contact Families

**Reach out if:**
- You've tried 2-3 strategies without improvement
- Student is falling significantly behind
- You need more information about patterns at home
- Family has expressed concerns
- You're preparing for a formal referral

**Use:** [Family Communication Templates](family_communication/) for guidance
