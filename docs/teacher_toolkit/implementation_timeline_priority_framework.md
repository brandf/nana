*What to try first, when to escalate, and how to track success*

---

## üéØ The Three-Tier Framework

### **Tier 1: Universal Supports (All Students)**
**Timeline**: Ongoing, continuous
**Goal**: Prevent problems before they start
**Who**: All students in your class
**Effort**: Low to moderate
**Resources**: Standard classroom materials

### **Tier 2: Targeted Supports (Some Students)**
**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks of intensive intervention
**Goal**: Address specific concerns with focused support
**Who**: 15-20% of students who need extra help
**Effort**: Moderate to high
**Resources**: Additional materials, small group time

### **Tier 3: Intensive Supports (Few Students)**
**Timeline**: 8-12 weeks of intensive, individualized intervention
**Goal**: Address severe or persistent concerns
**Who**: 5-10% of students with significant needs
**Effort**: High
**Resources**: Specialized materials, individual attention, outside support
