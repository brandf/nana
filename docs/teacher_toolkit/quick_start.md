# Teacher Quick Start Guide

*Your go-to resource for supporting students with learning needs*

## üö® What to do RIGHT NOW (First 5 minutes)

**If a student is struggling in your class:**

1. **Take a breath** - You're not expected to diagnose or fix everything immediately
2. **Observe objectively** - What exactly is happening? When? How often?
3. **Try one simple support** - Extended time, visual aids, or breaking down instructions
4. **Document briefly** - Date, what you saw, what you tried, how they responded
5. **Plan your next step** - Will you try more strategies or involve support staff?

## üìã What to do TODAY (First day)

**After noticing a pattern:**

1. **Try 2-3 basic supports** from the [Symptom Checker](symptom_checker.md)
2. **Document your observations** using the [Observation Template](../notes/teacher_observation_template.md)
3. **Check with colleagues** - Have they noticed similar patterns?
4. **Review the student's file** - Any previous concerns or supports noted?
5. **Plan your approach** - What will you try tomorrow?

## üìÖ What to do THIS WEEK (First week)

**If concerns persist:**

1. **Continue trying strategies** - Give interventions time to work (at least 3-5 days)
2. **Collect data** - Use the [Progress Monitoring Tools](progress_monitoring/)
3. **Reach out to family** - Use [Family Communication Templates](family_communication/)
4. **Involve support team** - Counselor, special education teacher, or administrator
5. **Document everything** - You'll need this for referrals and meetings
