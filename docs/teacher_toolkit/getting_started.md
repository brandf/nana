# Getting Started: A New Teacher's Guide

*Your step-by-step introduction to supporting students with learning needs*

---

## üéØ Welcome to the Teacher Toolkit!

This guide will walk you through the basics of supporting students with learning differences. Don't worry - you don't need to be an expert to make a difference!

---

## üìö What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll know how to:
- **Identify** when a student might need extra support
- **Try** simple strategies that help most students
- **Document** your observations and interventions
- **Communicate** with families about concerns
- **Know when** to ask for help

## üöÄ Step 1: Understanding Learning Differences

### **What Are Learning Differences?**
Learning differences are neurologically-based challenges that affect how students:
- **Process** information (reading, writing, math)
- **Focus** and pay attention
- **Organize** and plan their work
- **Communicate** and interact socially
- **Regulate** their emotions and behavior

### **Common Types You Might See:**
- **Dyslexia** - Reading and spelling difficulties
- **Dysgraphia** - Writing and handwriting challenges
- **Dyscalculia** - Math and number sense problems
- **ADHD** - Attention and executive function challenges
- **ASD** - Social communication and sensory differences
- **Executive Function** - Planning, organization, and self-control

### **Key Point:** These are NOT intelligence problems - they're processing differences!

## üîç Step 2: Learning to Observe

### **What to Look For**
Instead of looking for "problems," look for **patterns**:

#### **Academic Patterns**
- **Reading**: Slow, effortful reading; guessing at words; avoiding reading aloud
- **Writing**: Illegible handwriting; written work below oral ability; avoiding writing
- **Math**: Struggling with basic facts; confusion with place value; avoiding math tasks

#### **Behavioral Patterns**
- **Attention**: Easily distracted; can't sit still; forgets instructions
- **Organization**: Loses materials; messy desk; can't find assignments
- **Social**: Difficulty with group work; misreads social cues; prefers to work alone

#### **Emotional Patterns**
- **Frustration**: Cries easily; gives up quickly; says "I can't do this"
- **Avoidance**: Refuses to participate; makes excuses; acts out to avoid work
- **Anxiety**: Worries about school; physical symptoms; perfectionism

### **Practice Activity**
Choose one student and observe them for one week. Look for patterns in:
- When do they struggle most?
- What activities do they avoid?
- What seems to help them succeed?

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 3: Trying Simple Strategies

### **Universal Supports** (Help ALL Students)
These strategies benefit everyone, not just students with learning differences:

#### **Environmental Supports**
- **Clear routines** and expectations
- **Visual schedules** and reminders
- **Organized** classroom spaces
- **Reduced** distractions during work time

#### **Instructional Supports**
- **Multiple ways** to present information (visual, auditory, hands-on)
- **Break tasks** into smaller steps
- **Provide choices** when possible
- **Use technology** to support learning

#### **Behavioral Supports**
- **Positive reinforcement** for effort and progress
- **Movement breaks** every 20-30 minutes
- **Clear consequences** for behavior
- **Teach** self-regulation strategies

### **Quick Strategy Menu**
When you see a student struggling, try these in order:

1. **Reduce demands** - Break the task into smaller pieces
2. **Add support** - Provide visual aids, examples, or guidance
3. **Change the format** - Let them type instead of write, or draw instead of write
4. **Give choices** - "Would you like to work alone or with a partner?"
5. **Take a break** - Sometimes a short break helps reset

## üìù Step 4: Documenting Your Observations

### **Why Document?**
- **Track progress** over time
- **Identify patterns** in behavior
- **Share information** with support team
- **Show families** what you've tried
- **Make decisions** about next steps

### **What to Write Down**
- **Date and time** - When did this happen?
- **Specific behavior** - What exactly did you see?
- **Context** - What was happening before/during?
- **What you tried** - What strategy did you use?
- **How they responded** - What happened next?

### **Sample Documentation**
```
Date: 9/15/24
Student: Alex
Time: 10:30 AM
Context: Independent reading time
Observation: Student was flipping through pages quickly, not reading. When I asked what he was reading about, he said "I don't know."
Strategy tried: Offered to read the first paragraph together
Response: Student agreed, we read together, he was able to answer questions about what we read
Next step: Try pairing him with audio version of the book
```

## üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Step 5: Communicating with Families

### **When to Reach Out**
- **After trying** 2-3 strategies for a week
- **When you notice** a pattern of concerns
- **When the student** asks you to talk to their family
- **When families** express concerns to you

### **How to Start the Conversation**
- **Share positive** observations first
- **Describe specific** behaviors you've seen
- **Explain what** you've tried to help
- **Ask for** their observations and insights
- **Work together** on next steps

### **Sample Conversation Starters**
- "I wanted to share something I've noticed about [student's name]..."
- "I've been trying some strategies to help [student's name] with [specific area]..."
- "I'm wondering if you've noticed similar patterns at home..."
- "I'd like to work together to support [student's name]..."

### **What NOT to Say**
- "I think your child has [specific condition]"
- "This is definitely [diagnosis]"
- "They need to be tested for..."
- "This is a problem that needs fixing"

## üÜò Step 6: Knowing When to Ask for Help

### **Ask for Help When:**
- **You've tried** multiple strategies without success
- **The student** is getting worse, not better
- **You feel** overwhelmed or unsure what to do
- **The family** requests additional support
- **Other teachers** have similar concerns

### **Who to Ask**
- **Colleagues** - Other teachers who might have ideas
- **Special education teacher** - For academic accommodations
- **School counselor** - For social/emotional concerns
- **Administrator** - For resources or additional support
- **Support team** - For comprehensive evaluation

### **How to Ask for Help**
- **Be specific** about what you've observed
- **Share** what strategies you've tried
- **Explain** what you need help with
- **Ask** for specific suggestions or resources
- **Follow up** on recommendations

## üéØ Step 7: Building Your Confidence

### **Start Small**
- **Choose one student** to focus on first
- **Try one strategy** at a time
- **Give strategies** time to work (at least a week)
- **Celebrate** small successes
- **Learn** from what doesn't work

### **Build Your Skills Gradually**
- **Week 1-2**: Practice observing and documenting
- **Week 3-4**: Try universal supports with all students
- **Week 5-6**: Focus on one student with specific needs
- **Week 7-8**: Practice family communication
- **Ongoing**: Continue learning and growing

### **Remember:**
- **You don't have to** be perfect
- **Every student** is different
- **What works** for one might not work for another
- **Progress** takes time
- **You're not alone** in this work
