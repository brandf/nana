# Co-occurring Conditions

*How multiple learning differences interact and what to do about it*

---

## üîó Why Co-occurring Conditions Matter

### **The Reality**
- **60-80%** of students with learning differences have multiple conditions
- **ADHD + Dyslexia** occurs in 25-40% of cases
- **ASD + Language disorders** are very common
- **Anxiety + Learning disabilities** often go together
- Conditions **interact and amplify** each other

### **Why This Matters for Teachers**
- **Single interventions** may not work
- **Symptoms can mask** each other
- **Prioritizing** which condition to address first
- **Complex needs** require comprehensive approaches
