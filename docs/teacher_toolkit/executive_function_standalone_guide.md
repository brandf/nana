# Executive Function: A Comprehensive Guide

*Beyond ADHD - Supporting all students with executive function challenges*

---

## üß† What is Executive Function?

### **The Brain's CEO**
Executive function is like the **brain's CEO** - it manages, coordinates, and controls all other cognitive processes. It's what helps us:
- **Plan and organize** our work
- **Focus and pay attention** to what matters
- **Control impulses** and emotions
- **Remember** what we need to do
- **Switch** between tasks efficiently
- **Solve problems** creatively

### **Why This Matters for Teachers**
- **25-30%** of students have executive function challenges
- **Not just ADHD** - affects students with learning disabilities, anxiety, trauma, and more
- **Critical for academic success** - affects every subject area
- **Can be taught** - students can learn these skills
- **Early intervention** makes a huge difference
