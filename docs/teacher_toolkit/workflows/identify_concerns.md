# Identify Concerns Workflow

*Step-by-step process for identifying and documenting student concerns*

---

## üéØ Overview

This workflow helps you systematically identify when a student might need additional support and document your observations effectively.

---

## üìã Step 1: Initial Observation

### **What to Look For**
- **Academic patterns** - Consistent struggles in specific areas
- **Behavioral patterns** - Changes in engagement or behavior
- **Social patterns** - Difficulties with peer interactions
- **Emotional patterns** - Signs of frustration or anxiety

### **Documentation Template**
```
Date: ___________
Student: ___________
Observer: ___________

**What I observed:**
- Specific behavior or concern
- When it happened (time, activity, setting)
- How often it occurs
- What was happening before/during

**Context:**
- Classroom activity
- Other students present
- Environmental factors
- Student's apparent mood/energy

**My initial thoughts:**
- Possible causes
- Similar patterns I've noticed
- What might help
```

---

## üîç Step 2: Pattern Recognition

### **Look for Consistency**
- **Same behavior** across different activities?
- **Same time** of day or week?
- **Same triggers** or situations?
- **Getting better or worse** over time?

### **Compare to Peers**
- **Typical** for this age group?
- **Similar** to other students?
- **Significantly different** from peers?
- **Concerning** enough to warrant attention?

### **Check Multiple Sources**
- **Your observations** - What you see in class
- **Other teachers** - Similar concerns?
- **Student work** - Patterns in assignments?
- **Family input** - Concerns at home?

## üìä Step 3: Data Collection

### **Academic Data**
- **Test scores** and grades
- **Work samples** showing patterns
- **Reading fluency** data
- **Math computation** accuracy
- **Writing samples** and quality

### **Behavioral Data**
- **Frequency** of concerning behaviors
- **Duration** of episodes
- **Triggers** and antecedents
- **Consequences** and responses
- **Time of day** patterns

### **Social-Emotional Data**
- **Peer interactions** and relationships
- **Emotional regulation** abilities
- **Self-advocacy** skills
- **Confidence** and self-esteem
- **Stress indicators**

---

## üö® Step 4: Determine Severity

### **Green Light - Monitor**
- **Occasional** concerns
- **Typical** for age/development
- **Responds** to basic supports
- **No impact** on learning or others

### **Yellow Light - Investigate**
- **Regular** concerns
- **Somewhat unusual** for age
- **Partial response** to supports
- **Mild impact** on learning

### **Red Light - Take Action**
- **Frequent** concerns
- **Significantly different** from peers
- **No response** to supports
- **Significant impact** on learning or others

---

## üìù Step 5: Documentation

### **Essential Information**
- **Specific behaviors** observed
- **Frequency and duration** of concerns
- **Context** and triggers
- **Strategies tried** and results
- **Impact** on learning and others

### **Sample Documentation**
```
**Student:** Alex Johnson
**Date Range:** September 15-29, 2024
**Observer:** Ms. Smith

**Concerns Observed:**
- Reading: Reads 20 WPM below grade level, skips words, guesses at unfamiliar words
- Writing: Illegible handwriting, avoids writing tasks, written work below oral ability
- Behavior: Becomes frustrated during reading/writing, says "I can't do this"

**Frequency:**
- Reading concerns: Daily during independent reading
- Writing concerns: 3-4 times per week during writing tasks
- Behavioral concerns: 2-3 times per week when frustrated

**Context:**
- Occurs most during independent work time
- Less problematic during group activities
- Student seems more engaged with hands-on activities

**Strategies Tried:**
- 9/16: Offered audiobook for reading - student more engaged
- 9/20: Allowed typing for writing - student completed more work
- 9/25: Provided graphic organizer - student better organized thoughts

**Results:**
- Some improvement with accommodations
- Student still struggles with basic reading/writing skills
- Frustration levels decreased with supports

**Next Steps:**
- Continue with current accommodations
- Consider formal assessment if no further progress
- Involve family in discussion about concerns
```

## üîÑ Step 6: Next Steps

### **If Monitoring (Green)**
- **Continue** current supports
- **Check in** weekly
- **Document** any changes
- **Celebrate** progress

### **If Investigating (Yellow)**
- **Try additional** strategies
- **Collect more** data
- **Consult** with colleagues
- **Involve** support team

### **If Taking Action (Red)**
- **Implement** intensive supports
- **Involve** support team immediately
- **Contact** family
- **Consider** formal evaluation

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Resources

### **Observation Tools**
- **[Observation Template](tools/observation_templates.md)** - Structured observation form
- **[Behavior Tracking](tools/behavior_tracking.md)** - Frequency and duration tracking
- **[Academic Monitoring](tools/academic_monitoring.md)** - Progress tracking tools

### **Reference Materials**
- **[Red Flags vs. Typical Development](reference/red_flags_vs_typical_development.md)** - When to worry
- **[Age/Grade Considerations](reference/age_grade_considerations.md)** - Developmental expectations
- **[Symptom Checker](symptom_checker.md)** - Interactive decision tree

## üí° Best Practices

### **Do This**
- **Observe objectively** - Record what you see, not what you think
- **Collect data** over time - One observation isn't enough
- **Document everything** - You'll need it for referrals
- **Try strategies** before escalating
- **Involve others** - Get multiple perspectives

### **Don't Do This**
- **Jump to conclusions** - Gather data first
- **Compare unfairly** - Consider individual circumstances
- **Ignore small concerns** - They can become big problems
- **Work in isolation** - Use your team
- **Delay action** - When in doubt, ask for help

### **Safety Concerns**
- Student is a danger to self or others
- Severe behavioral outbursts
- Self-injurious behavior
- Threats of violence

### **Academic Concerns**
- Reading 2+ years below grade level
- Can't do basic math facts
- Writing illegible despite practice
- Complete academic disengagement

### **Social-Emotional Concerns**
- Complete social withdrawal

*Remember: The goal is to help students succeed, not to label or diagnose. Focus on what you can do to support the student's learning and well-being.*
