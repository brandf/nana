# Monitor Progress Workflow

*Step-by-step process for tracking student progress and adjusting interventions*

---

## üéØ Overview

This workflow helps you systematically track student progress, evaluate intervention effectiveness, and make data-driven decisions about next steps.

---

## üìä Step 1: Establish Baseline

### **What is Baseline Data?**
Baseline data is information about the student's current performance before you start an intervention. It helps you:
- **Measure** if the intervention is working
- **Set realistic** goals for improvement
- **Compare** before and after performance
- **Make decisions** about continuing or changing strategies

### **What to Measure**
- **Academic skills** - Reading fluency, math accuracy, writing quality
- **Behavioral patterns** - On-task time, work completion, following directions
- **Social-emotional** - Confidence, engagement, peer interactions
- **Strategy use** - How well the student uses accommodations

### **How to Collect Baseline Data**
- **Observe** the student for 3-5 days
- **Record** specific behaviors or skills
- **Use** the same measurement method you'll use later
- **Document** the current level of performance
- **Note** any patterns or trends

## üìà Step 2: Set Up Progress Monitoring

### **Choose Your Measurement Method**

#### **Academic Monitoring**
- **Reading fluency** - Words per minute, accuracy
- **Math computation** - Problems correct per minute
- **Writing** - Words written, quality scores
- **Spelling** - Words spelled correctly
- **Comprehension** - Questions answered correctly

#### **Behavioral Monitoring**
- **On-task behavior** - Percentage of time on task
- **Work completion** - Percentage of assignments completed
- **Following directions** - Number of directions followed correctly
- **Appropriate behavior** - Frequency of positive behaviors

#### **Social-Emotional Monitoring**
- **Engagement** - Level of participation in activities
- **Confidence** - Student self-report or teacher observation
- **Peer interactions** - Quality and frequency of social interactions
- **Self-regulation** - Ability to manage emotions and behavior

### **Data Collection Schedule**
- **Daily** - For intensive interventions
- **Weekly** - For most interventions
- **Bi-weekly** - For long-term monitoring
- **Monthly** - For general progress tracking

---

## üìã Step 3: Data Collection

### **Daily Data Collection**
- **Quick observations** - 2-3 times per day
- **Specific behaviors** - What you see, not what you think
- **Context** - When and where it happened
- **Response** - How the student responded to intervention

### **Weekly Data Collection**
- **Formal assessments** - Tests, quizzes, work samples
- **Behavior tracking** - Frequency and duration of behaviors
- **Student feedback** - How they feel about the intervention
- **Family input** - Observations from home

### **Data Collection Tools**
- **Observation forms** - Structured checklists
- **Progress charts** - Visual tracking of improvement
- **Work samples** - Before and after examples
- **Student self-assessment** - Student's view of progress
- **Family surveys** - Home observations and feedback

---

## üìä Step 4: Data Analysis

### **Look for Patterns**
- **Trends** - Is the student improving over time?
- **Consistency** - Is progress steady or inconsistent?
- **Variability** - Are there good days and bad days?
- **Triggers** - What seems to help or hinder progress?

### **Compare to Goals**
- **Are you on track** to meet the goal?
- **How much progress** has been made?
- **What's working** and what isn't?
- **What adjustments** might be needed?

### **Data Analysis Questions**
- **Is the student making progress?** (Yes/No/Somewhat)
- **Is the progress fast enough?** (Too slow/Just right/Too fast)
- **Is the intervention working?** (Yes/No/Partially)
- **What changes are needed?** (Continue/Adjust/Change completely)

---

## üîÑ Step 5: Decision Making

### **If Student is Making Good Progress**
- **Continue** the current intervention
- **Gradually reduce** support as student improves
- **Set new goals** for continued growth
- **Celebrate** success with student and family
- **Consider** applying strategies to other areas

### **If Student is Making Some Progress**
- **Continue** the intervention with minor adjustments
- **Provide additional** support or practice
- **Extend** the timeline for achieving goals
- **Monitor** more closely for continued improvement
- **Get input** from student and family

### **If Student is Not Making Progress**
- **Try different** strategies or approaches
- **Increase** intensity or frequency of intervention
- **Consult** with colleagues or support team
- **Consider** if goals are appropriate
- **Involve** family in problem-solving

### **If Student is Getting Worse**
- **Stop** the current intervention immediately
- **Consult** with support team right away
- **Consider** if there are other factors affecting the student
- **Involve** family and other professionals
- **Document** everything for future reference

---

## üìù Step 6: Documentation

### **What to Document**
- **Baseline data** - Starting point for intervention
- **Intervention details** - What strategy was used, when, how often
- **Progress data** - Regular measurements of student performance
- **Adjustments made** - Changes to intervention based on data
- **Final outcomes** - Whether goals were met and why

### **Documentation Template**
```
**Student:** [Name]
**Intervention:** [Strategy used]
**Goal:** [What you wanted to achieve]
**Timeline:** [Start date - End date]

**Baseline Data:**
- [Specific measurements before intervention]

**Progress Data:**
- Week 1: [Measurements and observations]
- Week 2: [Measurements and observations]
- Week 3: [Measurements and observations]
- Week 4: [Measurements and observations]

**Adjustments Made:**
- [Any changes to the intervention]

**Final Outcomes:**
- [Whether goal was met and why]
- [Next steps for the student]
```

## üéØ Step 7: Goal Adjustment

### **When to Adjust Goals**
- **Student exceeds** expectations quickly
- **Student struggles** to make progress
- **Circumstances change** for the student
- **New information** becomes available
- **Family requests** changes

### **How to Adjust Goals**
- **Make goals** more specific or measurable
- **Change timeline** for achieving goals
- **Modify expectations** based on student needs
- **Involve student** and family in goal setting
- **Document** reasons for changes

## üë• Step 8: Team Collaboration

### **When to Involve the Team**
- **No progress** after 2-3 weeks of intervention
- **Student needs** additional support or resources
- **Multiple concerns** across different areas
- **Family requests** team meeting
- **You need** additional expertise or support

### **Team Meeting Preparation**
- **Gather** all relevant data and documentation
- **Prepare** summary of concerns and strategies tried
- **Identify** specific questions or needs
- **Invite** appropriate team members
- **Set agenda** and goals for meeting

### **Team Meeting Process**
- **Share** observations and data
- **Discuss** what's working and what isn't
- **Brainstorm** new strategies or approaches
- **Assign** responsibilities and next steps
- **Set timeline** for follow-up

## üè† Step 9: Family Communication

### **Regular Updates**
- **Weekly or bi-weekly** progress reports
- **Celebrate** successes and improvements
- **Share** data and observations
- **Ask** for family input and feedback
- **Collaborate** on next steps

### **When Concerns Persist**
- **Schedule** formal meeting with family
- **Share** comprehensive data and documentation
- **Discuss** possible causes and solutions
- **Consider** formal evaluation if needed
- **Develop** action plan together

## üö® Step 10: Escalation

### **When to Escalate**
- **No progress** after 4-6 weeks of intervention
- **Student is getting worse** despite supports
- **Multiple strategies** tried without success
- **Family requests** formal evaluation
- **You feel** overwhelmed or unsure

### **How to Escalate**
- **Contact** support team or administrator
- **Provide** comprehensive documentation
- **Explain** what you've tried and results
- **Request** specific support or resources
- **Follow up** on recommendations

## üí° Best Practices

### **Do This**
- **Collect data** consistently and regularly
- **Use multiple** sources of information
- **Involve student** in monitoring their own progress
- **Celebrate** small wins and improvements
- **Be patient** - progress takes time
- **Adjust** strategies based on data

### **Don't Do This**
- **Ignore** data that doesn't support your assumptions
- **Give up** too quickly on interventions
- **Work in isolation** - use your team
- **Compare students** unfairly
- **Expect** perfect progress - ups and downs are normal
- **Forget** to document your observations
