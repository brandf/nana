# Try Strategies Workflow

*Step-by-step process for implementing and adjusting interventions*

---

## üéØ Overview

This workflow guides you through selecting, implementing, and adjusting strategies to support students with learning needs.

---

## üìã Step 1: Strategy Selection

### **Start with Universal Supports**
These help ALL students and are easy to implement:

#### **Environmental Supports**
- **Clear routines** and expectations
- **Visual schedules** and reminders
- **Organized** classroom spaces
- **Reduced** distractions during work time

#### **Instructional Supports**
- **Multiple ways** to present information
- **Break tasks** into smaller steps
- **Provide choices** when possible
- **Use technology** to support learning

#### **Behavioral Supports**
- **Positive reinforcement** for effort
- **Movement breaks** every 20-30 minutes
- **Clear consequences** for behavior
- **Teach** self-regulation strategies

### **Match Strategy to Need**
- **Reading difficulties** ‚Üí Audio support, visual aids
- **Writing challenges** ‚Üí Typing, speech-to-text
- **Math struggles** ‚Üí Manipulatives, visual models
- **Attention issues** ‚Üí Clear routines, movement breaks
- **Social difficulties** ‚Üí Explicit instruction, peer support

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Implementation Planning

### **Before You Start**
- **Choose 1-2 strategies** to try first
- **Set clear goals** for what you want to achieve

- **Prepare materials** you'll need
- **Set timeline** for trying the strategy

### **Implementation Checklist**
- [ ] **Strategy selected** based on student needs
- [ ] **Materials gathered** and ready
- [ ] **Student informed** about the strategy
- [ ] **Baseline data** collected

## üìä Step 3: Implementation

### **Week 1: Introduction**
- **Introduce** the strategy to the student
- **Explain** why you're using it
- **Model** how to use it
- **Practice** together
- **Provide** support and encouragement

### **Week 2: Practice**
- **Continue** using the strategy
- **Monitor** student response
- **Adjust** as needed
- **Collect** data on effectiveness
- **Provide** feedback and support

### **Week 3: Evaluation**
- **Assess** effectiveness
- **Decide** whether to continue, adjust, or try something else
- **Document** results
- **Plan** next steps

---

## üìà Step 4: Progress Monitoring

### **What to Track**
- **Academic progress** - Test scores, work quality
- **Behavioral changes** - Engagement, participation
- **Social-emotional** - Confidence, relationships
- **Strategy use** - How well student uses the strategy
- **Student feedback** - What they think about it

### **Data Collection Methods**
- **Daily observations** - Quick notes on what you see
- **Work samples** - Before and after examples
- **Student self-report** - How they feel about the strategy
- **Formal assessments** - Tests, quizzes, projects
- **Behavior tracking** - Frequency, duration, intensity

---

## üîÑ Step 5: Strategy Adjustment

### **If Strategy is Working**
- **Continue** using it
- **Gradually reduce** support as student improves
- **Teach** student to use it independently
- **Share** success with student and family
- **Consider** applying to other areas

### **If Strategy Needs Adjustment**
- **Modify** the strategy to better fit the student
- **Provide** more or different support
- **Change** the timing or frequency
- **Try** a different approach
- **Get** input from student and family

### **If Strategy Isn't Working**
- **Try** a completely different approach
- **Consult** with colleagues or support team
- **Consider** if the goal is appropriate
- **Involve** family in problem-solving
- **Document** what you've tried

## üéØ Step 6: Goal Setting

### **SMART Goals**
- **Specific** - What exactly do you want to achieve?
- **Measurable** - How will you know if you've achieved it?
- **Achievable** - Is this realistic for the student?
- **Relevant** - Does this matter for the student's success?
- **Time-bound** - When do you want to achieve this?

### **Example Goals**
- **Reading**: Student will read 60 WPM by end of semester
- **Writing**: Student will complete 3-sentence responses independently
- **Math**: Student will solve 8/10 basic addition problems correctly
- **Behavior**: Student will stay on task for 15 minutes without redirection
- **Social**: Student will participate in group discussions 3 times per week
