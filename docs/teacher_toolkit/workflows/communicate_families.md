# Communicate with Families Workflow

*Step-by-step process for effective family communication about student concerns*

---

## üéØ Overview

This workflow guides you through building positive relationships with families and communicating effectively about student concerns and progress.

---

## ü§ù Step 1: Building Relationships

### **First Contact - Making a Good Impression**
- **Introduce yourself** and your role
- **Share something positive** about the student
- **Express your commitment** to student success
- **Ask about** the student's interests and strengths
- **Listen actively** to family concerns and insights

### **Ongoing Relationship Building**
- **Regular positive** communication about successes
- **Show genuine interest** in the student and family
- **Respect family** expertise about their child
- **Be available** for questions and concerns
- **Celebrate** student achievements together

---

## üìû Step 2: Initial Contact About Concerns

### **When to Reach Out**
- **After trying** 2-3 strategies for a week
- **When you notice** a consistent pattern of concerns
- **When the student** asks you to talk to their family
- **When families** express concerns to you
- **Before** implementing major changes

### **How to Start the Conversation**
- **Choose the right time** - Not during busy periods
- **Use positive language** - Focus on student strengths
- **Be specific** about what you've observed
- **Explain what** you've tried to help
- **Ask for** family input and observations

### **Sample Conversation Starters**
- "I wanted to share something I've noticed about [student's name]..."
- "I've been trying some strategies to help [student's name] with [specific area]..."
- "I'm wondering if you've noticed similar patterns at home..."
- "I'd like to work together to support [student's name]..."

---

## üìù Step 3: Sharing Observations

### **What to Share**
- **Specific behaviors** you've observed
- **When and where** these behaviors occur
- **What you've tried** to help the student
- **How the student** has responded to strategies
- **Your concerns** and why you're reaching out

### **How to Share**
- **Use concrete examples** - "Yesterday during math, [student] struggled with..."
- **Avoid labels** - Don't use diagnostic terms
- **Focus on impact** - How it affects learning
- **Be objective** - Stick to facts, not opinions
- **Show empathy** - Acknowledge this might be difficult to hear

### **Sample Observation Sharing**
"I've noticed that [student] has been having some difficulty with reading tasks. For example, yesterday during independent reading time, I saw [student] flipping through pages quickly and when I asked what they were reading about, they said 'I don't know.' I tried offering to read the first paragraph together, and [student] was able to answer questions about what we read. I'm wondering if you've noticed similar patterns at home with reading or other activities."

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 4: Discussing Strategies

### **Share What You've Tried**
- **Describe strategies** you've implemented
- **Explain why** you chose these strategies
- **Share results** - What worked and what didn't
- **Ask for feedback** - What do they think?
- **Collaborate** on next steps

### **Ask for Family Input**
- **What strategies** have worked at home?
- **What challenges** do they see at home?
- **What strengths** does the student show at home?
- **What concerns** do they have?
- **What support** do they need?

### **Sample Strategy Discussion**
"I've been trying a few things to help [student] with reading. I've been pairing the text with audio versions, which seems to help with comprehension. I've also been breaking reading tasks into smaller chunks. [Student] seems more engaged when we do this. Have you tried anything at home that seems to help? What do you think about these approaches?"

## üìä Step 5: Sharing Progress Data

### **What Data to Share**
- **Baseline information** - Where the student started
- **Progress measurements** - How they're doing now
- **Work samples** - Before and after examples
- **Behavioral observations** - Changes in engagement or behavior
- **Student self-assessment** - How they feel about their progress

### **How to Present Data**
- **Use visual aids** - Charts, graphs, work samples
- **Explain what** the data means in simple terms
- **Focus on growth** - Even small improvements matter
- **Be honest** about challenges
- **Ask for interpretation** - What do they think this means?

---

## üéØ Step 6: Setting Goals Together

### **Collaborative Goal Setting**
- **Include student** in goal setting when appropriate
- **Make goals** specific and measurable
- **Set realistic** timelines for achievement
- **Consider family** priorities and concerns
- **Plan for** regular check-ins and updates

### **SMART Goals with Families**
- **Specific** - What exactly do we want to achieve?
- **Measurable** - How will we know if we've achieved it?
- **Achievable** - Is this realistic for the student?
- **Relevant** - Does this matter for the student's success?
- **Time-bound** - When do we want to achieve this?

## üìÖ Step 7: Planning Next Steps

### **Immediate Actions**
- **Continue** current strategies that are working
- **Try new** strategies based on family input

- **Discuss** transition planning if appropriate
- **Identify** additional resources or support
- **Set up** regular communication schedule

## üö® Step 8: Difficult Conversations

### **When Concerns are Serious**
- **Student is significantly** behind peers
- **Multiple areas** of concern
- **Behavioral issues** affecting learning
- **Social-emotional** concerns
- **Family is resistant** to discussing concerns

### **How to Handle Difficult Conversations**
- **Prepare thoroughly** - Gather all relevant information
- **Choose appropriate** setting and timing
- **Start with empathy** - Acknowledge this is difficult
- **Use "I" statements** - Focus on your observations
- **Listen actively** - Give family time to process and respond
- **Offer support** - You're there to help, not judge
- **Follow up** - Check in after the conversation

### **Sample Difficult Conversation**
"I know this might be difficult to hear, but I'm concerned about [student's] progress in several areas. I've noticed that [student] is struggling with [specific areas], and despite trying different strategies, we haven't seen the improvement I'd hoped for. I'm wondering if we should consider getting some additional support or evaluation to better understand how to help [student] succeed. I want you to know that I'm here to support both [student] and your family through this process."
