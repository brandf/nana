# For Teachers: Quick Guide to Classroom Signs and What Helps

Purpose: Fast, practical cues for what you might try right now. Not for diagnosis—use to guide support and documentation and to communicate with families and your student support team.

## Quick symptom → consider → try now

- If you see: Slow, inaccurate oral reading; guessing/skipping words; weak spelling
  - Consider: Dyslexia / word-level reading difficulty
  - Try now: Structured Literacy routines (phonics review, blending drills, dictation), pair texts with audio, reduce decoding-heavy copying, extended time

- If you see: Illegible/slow handwriting; written output far below oral expression
  - Consider: Dysgraphia / transcription difficulty
  - Try now: Provide guided notes; allow typing or speech-to-text; short handwriting practice; graphic organizers; accept oral responses when appropriate

- If you see: Struggles with number sense, place value, fractions; slow facts; multi-step errors
  - Consider: Dyscalculia / math difficulty
  - Try now: Concrete–representational–abstract (manipulatives → visuals → symbols); worked examples; number lines; step-by-step scaffolds; spaced retrieval practice

- If you see: Off-task, impulsive, inconsistent work completion; loses materials
  - Consider: [ADHD](https://www.cdc.gov/adhd/school-success.html) / executive function challenges
  - Try now: Clear rules and routines; behavior-specific praise; token/point system; chunk tasks; movement breaks; visual schedule; planner checks

- If you see: Difficulty following multi-step directions; vague/immature sentences; weak vocabulary
  - Consider: [Developmental Language Disorder (DLD)](https://www.asha.org/practice-portal/clinical-topics/spoken-language-disorders/) / language needs
  - Try now: Break directions into steps; model/recast sentences; preteach vocabulary with visuals and examples; check for understanding and ask student to rephrase

- If you see: Difficulty with change, group work, social cues; sensory sensitivities
  - Consider: [Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)](https://afirm.fpg.unc.edu/afirm-modules) differences
  - Try now: Visual schedules; advance warnings; clear, concrete language; teach/role-play routines; offer predictable choices; adjust sensory environment

- If you see: "Doesn't listen," needs frequent repetition, struggles in noise
  - Consider: [Auditory Processing Disorder (APD)](https://www.asha.org/practice-portal/clinical-topics/central-auditory-processing-disorder/) differences
  - Try now: Preferential seating; slow/clear speech with pauses; supplement with written directions and visuals; minimize background noise; confirm understanding

- If you see: Loses place on the page; messy alignment; slow on visual tasks
  - Consider: Visual processing/visual-motor challenges
  - Try now: Reduce visual clutter; larger fonts/spacing; graph paper; reading guides; copies of board notes; extra time

- If you see: Strong talker but struggles with spatial tasks, math concepts, and social perception
  - Consider: [Nonverbal Learning Disability (NVLD)](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/education-evidence/guidance-reports/send) profile
  - Try now: Make thinking visible with diagrams/maps; explicit spacing/organization routines; model social interpretations; scaffold math with [CRA](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/18) (Concrete-Representational-Abstract)

## High-impact routines to build into lessons

- Teach explicitly, practice with feedback, and review cumulatively
- Use visuals and organizers; preteach key vocabulary; combine visual + verbal (dual coding)
- Space practice over time; use retrieval practice and worked examples
- Build movement and choice into lessons to sustain attention
- Use assistive tech when the task goal is not handwriting/decoding (text-to-speech, speech-to-text, audiobooks)

## What to jot down (for [RTI/MTSS](https://iris.peabody.vanderbilt.edu/module/rti01/) and family conversations)

- Concern and impact on classwork (brief)
- Date + task examples
- Supports tried and student response
- Patterns (time of day, task type, environment)
- Date of family contact and summary
