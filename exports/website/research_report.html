                <p><h1>Learning Needs in School-Age Children: Presentations, Research-Based Classroom Supports, and Teacher Resources</h1></p><p><br>Audience: General education and special education teachers; school leaders</p><p><br>This guide summarizes common learning disabilities and related conditions that present in classrooms, what teachers tend to observe, and research-based supports that can be implemented without a diagnosis. It also includes teacher-friendly resources grounded in rigorous evidence. It is not a diagnostic tool; use it to inform support and documentation that can help families pursue formal evaluation.</p><p><br><h2>How to use this guide</h2></p><p><br>- Observe: Match classroom behaviors with the ‚ÄúHow it presents‚Äù lists.</p><p><br>- Support: Try the ‚ÄúWhat helps (evidence-based)‚Äù supports first; note responses.</p><p><br>- Document: Keep brief notes under ‚ÄúWhat to document‚Äù to share with families and evaluators.</p><p><br>- Refer: When concerns persist, coordinate with your school team to initiate <a href="https://iris.peabody.vanderbilt.edu/module/rti01/">MTSS/RTI</a> supports and, if needed, a formal special education/504 referral.</p><p><br>---</p><p><br><h2>Dyslexia (reading, word-level; language-based)</h2></p><p><br>- How it presents (in class)</p><p><br>  - Slow, effortful oral reading; skips or guesses words; avoids reading aloud</p><p><br>  - Trouble with letter‚Äìsound mappings, blending, spelling; weak nonsense word reading</p><p><br>  - Comprehension improves significantly when text is read aloud</p><p><br>- What helps (evidence-based)</p><p><br>  - Explicit, systematic phonics and phonemic awareness within a <a href="https://dyslexiaida.org/structured-literacy/">Structured Literacy</a> approach (daily, cumulative, multisensory)</p><p><br>  - Teach morphology (prefixes/suffixes), high-utility spelling patterns; repeated reading for fluency</p><p><br>  - Access supports: audiobooks/text-to-speech; reduced volume of decoding-heavy work when task focus is content</p><p><br>  - Assessment accommodations: extended time; read-aloud for directions and non-reading constructs</p><p><br>- What to document for families/evaluators</p><p><br>  - Frequency/examples of decoding errors, fluency rates, spelling patterns, response to explicit phonics practice</p><p><br>- Teacher resources (evidence-based, teacher-friendly)</p><p><br>  - <a href="https://dyslexiaida.org/fact-sheets/">International Dyslexia Association (IDA)</a> Fact Sheets and Structured Literacy overview</p><p><br>  - <a href="https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/PracticeGuide/1">IES What Works Clearinghouse (WWC)</a> Practice Guide: Foundational Skills to Support Reading (K‚Äì3)</p><p><br>  - Books: Overcoming Dyslexia (S. & J.
