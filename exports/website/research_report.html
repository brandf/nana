<p>Audience: General education and special education teachers; school leaders</p>

<p>This guide summarizes common learning disabilities and related conditions that present in classrooms, what teachers tend to observe, and research-based supports that can be implemented without a diagnosis. It also includes teacher-friendly resources grounded in rigorous evidence. It is not a diagnostic tool; use it to inform support and documentation that can help families pursue formal evaluation.</p>

<h2>How to use this guide</h2>
<ul><li>Observe: Match classroom behaviors with the ‚ÄúHow it presents‚Äù lists.</li><li>Support: Try the ‚ÄúWhat helps (evidence-based)‚Äù supports first; note responses.</li><li>Document: Keep brief notes under ‚ÄúWhat to document‚Äù to share with families and evaluators.</li><li>Refer: When concerns persist, coordinate with your school team to initiate <a href="https://iris.peabody.vanderbilt.edu/module/rti01/">MTSS/RTI</a> supports and, if needed, a formal special education/504 referral.</li></ul>

<h2>Executive summary (for leadership/quick read)</h2>
<ul><li>Many learning needs present first as classroom performance issues (reading fluency/accuracy, written output, math problem solving, attention/executive skills, language comprehension). Early, explicit, and well-structured supports are the highest-yield actions.</li><li>Strong evidence supports explicit, systematic instruction (reading, writing, math), combined with assistive technology and reasonable assessment accommodations.</li><li>Behavior-classroom management and organizational supports improve access for attention/executive challenges.</li><li>Visual schedules, modeling, and structured routines improve predictability and engagement for ASD and related profiles.</li><li>Teachers should document observations, supports tried, and student responses to streamline referrals and evaluations.</li></ul>
