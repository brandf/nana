<p><strong>Subject: Renewal Request - Bridges to Success Program</strong></p>

<p>Dear Frey Foundation Team,</p>

<p>I am writing to request renewal funding for our Bridges to Success program, which has exceeded all expectations in its first year of implementation. With your continued support, we can build on our success and expand our impact to serve even more students and families in the Grand Rapids community.</p>

<p><strong>Year 1 Achievements</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to Frey Foundation's initial investment of $50,000, we have achieved remarkable results:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Served 180 students</strong> (20% more than projected)</li><li><strong>Achieved 28% improvement</strong> in reading fluency (exceeded 25% goal)</li><li><strong>Trained 65 teachers</strong> (30% more than projected)</li><li><strong>Engaged 140 families</strong> (17% more than projected)</li><li><strong>Established 7 community partnerships</strong> (40% more than projected)</li></ul>

<p><strong>Student Success Stories</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Maria, 3rd grade:</strong> Improved reading fluency from 45 to 78 words per minute</li><li><strong>James, 5th grade:</strong> Increased math accuracy from 60% to 85%</li><li><strong>Sarah, 2nd grade:</strong> Enhanced writing skills and now loves creative writing</li></ul>

<p><strong>Year 2 Goals and Objectives</strong></p>
<p>With renewed funding, we will:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Expand to 15 schools</strong> (from 10 in Year 1)</li><li><strong>Serve 250 students</strong> (39% increase from Year 1)</li><li><strong>Train 80 teachers</strong> (23% increase from Year 1)</li><li><strong>Engage 180 families</strong> (29% increase from Year 1)</li><li><strong>Establish 10 community partnerships</strong> (43% increase from Year 1)</li></ul>

<p><strong>Budget for Year 2</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Personnel:</strong> $50,000 (Program Coordinator 1.0 FTE, Specialist 0.75 FTE)</li><li><strong>Equipment/Supplies:</strong> $12,000 (Expanded technology and materials)</li><li><strong>Professional Development:</strong> $8,000 (Enhanced training programs)</li><li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> $3,000 (Ongoing assessment and improvement)</li><li><strong>Indirect Costs:</strong> $2,000 (Administrative support)</li><li><strong>Total:</strong> $75,000</li></ul>

<p>We would welcome the opportunity to discuss our renewal request and share more detailed information about our Year 1 achievements and Year 2 plans. I will follow up within two weeks to schedule a conversation.</p>
